        <p>
          Demand is the entire relationship between prices and how much people

          particular price.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, the change in demand shifts the{" "}

          demanded changes <Emphasize>ALONG</Emphasize> the curve.

        In this lesson, we learned about the supply and demand model and how to
        use it to set the best price to make the most money.

            Here are some questions to ponder about as you continue your Econ
            journey:
          </Emphasize>
          <br />
          - Can you create a situation where price stays the same but quantity
          increases?
          <br />
          - Is it possible to shift both curves and keep the equilibrium
          unchanged?
          <br />
          - Can you create a situation where price goes up and quantity goes
          down?
          <br />
        </ColorBox>
        <br />
        <p>
          Thinking about these questions will help you understand not only the
          supply and demand model, but also the real world.
