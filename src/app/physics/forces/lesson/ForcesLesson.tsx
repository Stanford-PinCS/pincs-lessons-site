    <Block color="blue" title="What is a force?">
      <p>
        <Emphasize>
          A <KeyTerm>force</KeyTerm> is an influence that causes an object ot
          accelerate
        </Emphasize>
        . Essentially, a force is a <Emphasize>push or pull</Emphasize>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you play Tug of War, pulling on the rope is exerting a force.
        Similarly, any time you carry objects, or even just walk, you are
        exerting forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every force has a{" "}
        <Emphasize>magnitude (how strong the force is)</Emphasize> and a{" "}
        <Emphasize>direction (where the force goes)</Emphasize>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The magnitude of forces are often{" "}
        <Emphasize>
          measured in <KeyTerm>Newtons (N)</KeyTerm>
        </Emphasize>
        , but they can also be measured in pounds (lbs).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you are climbing up a ladder, you are pulling your
        entire body weight (the magnitude) upward (the direction).
      </p>
      <ClimbingAnimation />
    </Block>,

    // Slide 3: Explaining basics around forces.
    <Block color="blue" title="Newton's Laws">
      <p>
        <Emphasize>Newton's First Law</Emphasize> (also known as The Law of
        Inertia) states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion
        unless acted upon by a net external force.
      </p>
      <ColorBox color="blue">
        Just like how a drop of rain keeps falling until it gets stopped by the
        ground, every object won't change its velocity unless there's a force.
      </ColorBox>
      <p>
        <Emphasize>Newton's Second Law</Emphasize> tells us how to calculate the
        effect of a force: <KeyTerm>F = ma</KeyTerm>, where <KeyTerm>F</KeyTerm>{" "}
        is force, <KeyTerm>m</KeyTerm> is mass, and <KeyTerm>a</KeyTerm> is
        acceleration.
      </p>
      <ColorBox color="blue">
        Eventhough it gives us the formula as F = ma, since we're often given
        the force and want to find the acceleration, it can be helpful to
        rewrite it as: <ReactKatex>{`$a = \\frac{F}{m}$`}</ReactKatex>. This
        also helps us understand that a large force can get cancelled out by a
        large mass.
      </ColorBox>
      <p>
        <Emphasize>Newton's Third Law</Emphasize> says that for every action,
        there is an equal and opposite reaction.
      </p>
      <ColorBox color="blue">
        Imagine if you punched a wall. You're the one making the force against
        the wall, but your hand would still hurt. That's because however much
        force you put into the wall, the wall exerts right back at you!

    // Slide 5: Thinking about direction & magnitude.
    <Block color="blue" title="Forces are vectors">
      <p>
        Since forces are <KeyTerm>vectors</KeyTerm>, they have both a magnitude
        and a direction. However,{" "}
        <Emphasize>sometimes, we only care about one part of a force</Emphasize>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you're walking up a hill, it's important to break up
        gravity to see how much of gravity is pushing you into the hill and how
        much gravity is pushing you downhill.

    // Slide 6: Splitting up forces.
    <Block color="yellow" title="Splitting a force into components">
      <p>
        Sometimes a force acts at an angle. In these cases, we often split the
        force into two components: one horizontal and one vertical.
      </p>
      <p>This process uses trigonometry:</p>
      <p>
        Since cosine gives us a number between -1 and 1 telling us what fraction
        of the total force is in the x-direction, we can multiply it by the
        magnitude to get x-component of our force.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Sine does the same for our y-component. You can see them both in action
        in the diagram below.
